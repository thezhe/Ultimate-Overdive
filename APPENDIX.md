# Why Make a New Overdrive Pedal?
There's countless overdrives on the market -- it seems like there's a pedal that works for every musician in every genre. On the other hand, if you look closer at the circuits of these pedals, contain the same core nonlinear 'clipping' stage. Why so little innovation? One of my personal goals in making ***Ultimate-Overdrive*** is to upgrade this section and take advantage of a more nuianced design.

Talk about
-high slew rate opamps (OPA)
-linear vs nonlinear stages
-diode vs transistor clipping
-TWE
-Thunderbird
-solid state tube emulation
-classical soft/hard clipping
-Klon, DS1, SD1, Distortion+, Tubescreamer
