# Ultimate-Overdive 
## Idea Dependency Graph
[Trainwreck Express](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainwreck_Circuits) (Amp) -> [Ethos TWE-1 Overdrive](customtonesinc.com/home.html) (Amp Sim Pedal) -> [Derailer Overdrive](pedalpcb.com/product/derailer/) (Pedal Clone) -> this project
## Background
Overdrive pedals tend to kill dynamics. The goal of this project is to create a solid state plexi-like pedal with minimal components. In other words, 9v power, a single opamp, and low pass tone control. The tone relies on high quality opamps driving a carefully placed diodes, resistors, and capacitors.
