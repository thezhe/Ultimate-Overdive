# Ultimate-Overdive 
***Ultimate-Overdrive*** is a solid-state guitar pedal with touch-sensitive [Plexi](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/marshall-plexi-guitar-amps-everything-you-need-to-know)-like tones. Two parameters (drive and volume) control the single gain stage; high-quality opamp drives carefully placed diodes, resistors, and capacitors to produce a dynamic overdrive.
