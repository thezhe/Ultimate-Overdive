# Ultimate-Overdive
LTspice model of my ideal overdrive pedal
## Inspiration
[Trainwreck Express](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainwreck_Circuits) (Amp) -> [Ethos TWE-1 Overdrive](customtonesinc.com/home.html) (Amp Sim Pedal) -> [Derailer Overdrive](pedalpcb.com/product/derailer/) (Pedal Clone) -> this project

Many guitar overdrive pedals sound harsh and dynamically flat. To fulfill my desire for a low voltage, solid state plexi-like tone, I am making this project. The design of this pedal is focused on high quality opamps that drive clipping diodes in a minimally complex circuit.
